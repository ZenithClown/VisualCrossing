<div align = "justify">

In collaboration with [VisualCrossing](https://www.visualcrossing.com/weather-data) as a Weather Ambassador, I am creating a *python wrapper* that can be used to fetch the historical, latest, and forecast weather data. The Visual Crossing Weather API provides developers with weather data for any programming language or script, using simple `.get()` requests. The Weather API provides instant and scalable access to historical weather reports and forecast data in an easy-to-use JSON or text format.

## Plans & Pricing

VisualCrossing provides five different types of subscriptions, with either *monthly* or *annual* payable plans. The annual payable plans offer *two months* of free data usage, i.e., about 16% cheaper than the monthly plan. The below table highlights the plan details (which may change over time), for more details visit [VisualCrossing/pricing](https://www.visualcrossing.com/weather-data-editions).

<div align = "center">

| Plan Name | Costing Details | No. API Calls |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Free Tier | $ 0.00 / month | 1,000 (1k) Records/Month |
| Professional Tier | $ 35.00 / month | 10,000,000 (10M) Records/Month |
| Metered Connection (pay as you use) | $ 0.0001 / record | *unlimited* |
| Corporate Tier | $ 150.00 / month | *unlimited* |

</div>

In addition, you can contact the support for enterprise solutions. The `free` and `professional` tier has a single concurrency usage, while the `metered` connection has unlimited concurrency while the corporate account has a team concurrency and is billed together. The API service provided historical data of the last 50 years (currently, the data is available from 1975, as of 21.01.2024), while a **15-Days forecast** data is available under each tier.
