  I'm Debmalya Pramanik, working in collaboration with <a href = "https://www.visualcrossing.com/weather-data">VisualCrossing</a> to make a <i>python wrapper</i> that will be able
  to fetch data with ease.
  This API will be helpful to many as there are not much tools like Visual Crossing, and being an experience prationer in python, and love for <i>open-source</i> I decided to make
  a wrapper which will be fetch data with ease - without the need of writing API endpoints!<br>
  <b>Objective:</b> A single and a simple function which will fetch data as per given arguments.
